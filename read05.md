## Comparison Operators 

*Used to evaluate a situation by comparing one value to another and the result will be a **Boolean** (True/False).*


|    **Comparison Operator**      |                             **Task**                                   |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Equal to ==**                 | Compare two values to see if they have the same value                  |
|                                 |                                                                        |
| **Strict Equal to ===**         | Compare two values to see if they have the same value and datatype     |
|                                 |                                                                        |
| **Not Equal to !=**             | Compare two values to see if they are not the same                     |
|                                 |                                                                        |
| **Strict Not Equal to !==**     | Compare two values to see if they are not the same and datatype        |
|                                 |                                                                        |
| **Greater than >**              | Check if the left number is greater than to the right number           |
|                                 |                                                                        |
| **Greater than or Equal to >=** | Check if the left number is greater than or equal the right number     |
|                                 |                                                                        |
| **Less than <**                 | Check if the left number is less than to the right number              |
|                                 |                                                                        |
| **Less than or Equal to <=**    | Check if the left number is less than or equal the right number        |
|                                 |                                                                        |




## Logical Operators

*Used to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.*


|    **Logical Operator**      |                       **Task**                          |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Logical And &&**           | Tests if both expressions evaluate to true              |
|                              |                                                         |
| **Logical Or**               | Tests if one of both expressions evaluates to true      |
|                              |                                                         |
| **Logical Not !**            | Inverts the Boolean value                               |
|                              |                                                         |




## Loops: 

*Used to check a condition, if it evaluates to true, a code block will run until the condition evaluates to false.*


|    **Loop**     |                                            **Task**                                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FOR**         | The code will be running a specific number of times                                                      |
|                 |                                                                                                          |
| **WHILE**       | The code will be running as long as the condition is True                                                |
|                 |                                                                                                          |
| **DO WHILE**    | The code will run at least once even the condition is false and running as long as the condition is True |
|                 |                                                                                                          |

**For loop** is made up of three statements:

- **Initialization**: Create a variable.

- **Condition**: Made of Comparison or Logical operator statement.

- **Update**: The change that will happen every time after the loop code finish.

**While loop** is made up of a condition statement only.
