* What does the /:id mean in a route?



* What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?

    **The main difference between the PUT and PATCH methods is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.**

* How do you make a default value in a schema?

    **Create a new document without that path set**

    **Internal Server Error**

* What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?

    **The 200 status code is by far the most common returned. It means, simply, that the request was received and understood and is being processed. A 201 status code indicates that a request was successful and as a result, a resource has been created**
