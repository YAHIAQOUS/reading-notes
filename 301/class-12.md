# Mongo and Mongoose


## **nosql vs sql**


* Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|                SQL                     |                               NoSQL                                    |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | Called as non-relational or distributed database)                      |
| Table based databases                  | Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| Have predefined schema                 | Have dynamic schema for unstructured data                              |
| Vertically scalable                    | Horizontally scalable                                                  |
| Uses SQL ( structured query language ) | Uses UnQL (Unstructured Query Language)                                |

* What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

    **For the complex query intensive environment**

* Give a real world example

    **MySQL Community Edition**

* What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

    **For the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.**


* Give a real world example

    **MongoDB**

* Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

    **NoSQL database**

* Which type of database is best for scalability?

    **NoSQL database**

* What does SQL stand for?

    **Structured Query Language**

* What is a realational database?

    **Database works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and it supports the sql**

* What type of structure does a relational database work with?

    **Structured Query Language**

* What is a ‘schema’?

    **Define which data can ho into a table and defined by so-called fields**

* What is a NoSQL database?

    **Type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first**

* How does it work?

    **Have collections instead of tables, in such a collection have documents**

* What is inside of a Mongo database?

    **Collections, in such a collection have documents**

* Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

    **MongoDB, because relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models.**

* What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

    **When having a lot of write requests that affect multiple collections it will duplicating data instead of keeping relations**
