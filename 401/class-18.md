# Cryptography

## Encryption, decryption, and cracking

- One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.

- The word Cryptography comes from the roots 'crypto' and 'graphy'

- **Encryption**: The process of making text secret.

- **Decryption**: The reverse process of Encryption.

### **Cracking the cipher main techniques**

- **Frequency analysis** - Find the repetition of letters more than others

- **Known plaintext** - If you already knew some part of the plaintext

- **Brute force** - Try all the possibilities

## Types of Cryptography

- **Hashing** - changes a message into an unreadable string of text for the purpose of verifying the messageâ€™s contents, not hiding the message itself.

- **Symmetric Cryptography** - uses a single key to encrypt a message and then decrypt that message upon delivery.

- **Asymmetric Cryptography** - uses two different keys for encryption and decryption, as opposed to the single key used in symmetric cryptography.

- **Key Exchange Algorithms** - A key exchange algorithm, like Diffie-Hellman, is used to safely exchange encryption keys with an unknown party.

## Types of Cryptographic Functions

- **Authentication**

- **Nonrepudiation**

- **Confidentiality**

- **Integrity**
