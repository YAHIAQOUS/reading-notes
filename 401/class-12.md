# Pandas for Data Science

**_Pandas is a game-changer for data science and analytics_**

pandas is a **Python library** that has simple, powerful, and efficient functionality for performing resampling operations during frequency conversion (e.g., converting secondary data into 5-minutely data). This is extremely common in, but not limited to, financial applications.

pandas is like **Excel in Python**: it uses tables (namely DataFrame) and operates transformations on the data. But it can do a lot more.

By “group by” we are referring to a process involving one or more of the following steps:

- **Splitting** the data into groups based on some criteria

- **Applying** a function to each group independently

- **Combining** the results into a data structure
