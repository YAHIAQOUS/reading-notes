# Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Bokeh)

## Matplotlib

**IPython** is an **enhanced interactive Python shell** that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging, and much more.

pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM).

### **Animation**

For quite a long time, animation in matplotlib was not an easy task and was done mainly through clever hacks. However, things have started to change since version 1.1 and the introduction of tools for creating animation very intuitively, with the possibility to save them in all kinds of formats.

The easiest way to make an animation in matplotlib is to **declare a FuncAnimation object** that specifies to matplotlib what is the figure to update, what is the update function, and what is the delay between frames.

## Bokeh

Bokeh is an **interactive visualization library** that targets modern web browsers for presentation. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and affords high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets. It is good for:

- **Interactive visualization in modern browsers**

- **Standalone HTML documents, or server-backed apps**

- **Expressive and versatile graphics**

- **Large, dynamic, or streaming data**

- **Easy usage from python** (or Scala, or R, or...)

Bokeh can draw many types of visual shapes (called glyphs), including lines, bars, patches, hex tiles, and more. One of the most common visualization tasks is to draw a scatter plot of data using small marker glyphs to represent each point.
