# Growth Mindset

### God created the world that changes over time and gave us the ** Strength to influence it. ** 

So, we have to adapt and keep pace with what human knowledge and skills have reached today. This fact led me to be a student all my life and keep my mind growing every day.

Don't say: ~~I can't do this~~ but say I can't yet.
