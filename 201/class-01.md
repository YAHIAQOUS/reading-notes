**JavaScript** allows programmers to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser

JavaScript can make the web page more interactive by:

* Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
* React to events triggered by the user or browser

Examples of JavaScripts in the browser:
