# Practical Information

**Search engine optimization (SEO)** is the practice of trying to help the site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that the website covers.

Search engines do not only look at what appears on the site, they also consider how many sites link. For this reason, SEO is often split into two areas: 

1- **On-Page Techniques**: The methods that can be used on the web pages to improve their rating in search engines, by looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to find the site, and then including these in the text and HTML code

2- **Off-Page Techniques**: Search engines help determine how to rank the site by looking at the number of other sites that link to it


In every page of website there are **seven key** places where keywords(the words people might search on to find the site) can appear in order to improve its findability:

1- **Page title**:  *< title >* element inside the *< head >* element

2- **URL / WeB address** 

3- **Headings**: *< hn >* elements

4- **Text**

5- **Link text**

6- **Image alt text**

7- **Page descriptions**:  *< meta >* tag inside the *< head >* element 

There are several tools that allow entering keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords might like to consider, such as:
* adwords.google.co.uk/select/KeywordToolExternal
* www.wordtracker.com
* www.keyworddiscovery.com

One of the best tools for analyzing how users found the site, what they were looking at, and at what point they are leaving is a free service offered by Google called **Google Analytics**
