# Introduction to JavaScript

**JavaScript** allows programmers to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser

JavaScript can make the web page more interactive by:

* Access the content of the page
* Modify the content of the page
* Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
* React to events triggered by the user or browser

Examples of JavaScripts in the browser:

* **Slideshows**
* **Forms**
* **Reload part of the page**
* **Filtering data**

**jQuery** helps to deal with cross-browser inconsistencies

**Script:** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal

Tips To start writing a script:

1- Define the goal

2- Design the script (Sketching out using flowchart)

3- Code each step

## Expressions and Operators

Types of expressions:

1- Expressions that just assign a value to a variable

    *var name = 'yahia'*

2- Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

    *var money = 500+600*

**Operators:** Expressions used to allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

Types of Operators:

* **Assignment Operators** (Assign a value to a variable)
* **Arithmetic Operators** (Perform basic math)
* **Comparison Operators** (Compare two values and return true or fa1se)
* **Logical Operators** (Combine expressions and return true or fa1se)
* **String Operators** (Combine two strings)
