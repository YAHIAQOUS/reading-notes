Choosing the text editor depends on the person, the one you enjoy using, use it

Text editors help web developers writing their codes by their features, like code completion, syntax highlighting, and plug extensions

Default text editors on the computer, like notepad, have fewer features than advanced editors we installed, like Visual Studio Code


The most advanced text editors:

* NotePad++ (Work on Windows computers only and free to use)

* TextWrangler (Work on Mac computers only and retired in 2017)

* BB Edit (Work on Mac computers only and have a 30-day free trial then you can purchase)

* Visual Studio Code (Work on All computers and free to use)

* Atom (Work on All computers and brought by the folks at GitHub)

* Brackets (Work on All computers and free to use)

* Sublime Text (Free to use and can be purchased to use all its features)


IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) have multiple features and tasks than text editors all coming together.
